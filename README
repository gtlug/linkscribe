README for linkscribe

linkscribe is an IRC bot written in Perl.

It sits in a channel and watches for URLs.

When seen, it shortens URLs and echos the shortened URL
to the channel.


Example oneliner for new system:
perl -MLS::Controller -le 'my $ls = LS::Controller->new( botname => "linkscribe" ); print $ls->botname . "\n"; $ls->parse;  print "howdy";'

The oneliner assumes your PERL5LIB env variable is pointing at repo.git/LS 

Right now, it doesn't do much except print out an exception.
